# Machine Learning Concept
## 1. Activation Function
Activation function is used in the neuron of the hidden layers for mapping the summed weighted input value to the output value.

The activation function can be divided into two types:    
* Linear Activation Function
* Non-linear Activation Function
The linear activation function will turn the neural network into one layer which is a simple linear regression model.

The non-linear activation function allows the model to create complex mappings between the networkâ€™s inputs and outputs. The examples are:

## 2. What is sigmoid? 
- Sigmoid Function
- The Sigmoid function value ranges from (0,1)
